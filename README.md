# Famine: Fact or Fiction

## Introduction and Purpose

While staple foods vary greatly from region to region, just $15$ crops provide $90\%$ of the world's food energy intake, [according to the United Nation's FAO](https://www.fao.org/3/u8480e/U8480E07.htm#Staple%20foods%20What%20do%20people%20eat), with rice, maize, and wheat making up two thirds of this.

This is a study on the world's primary staple crops' production, allocation, and loss over time relative to population growth. The goal is to determine whether the world as a whole is better or worse equipped to feed itself.

## Inspiration

The Bible teaches that, in the end times, the world will experience birth-pain-like famines (increasing in severity and intensity). It is written in Matthew 24:1-8 (emphasis mine):

> "As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, 'Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?' 
>
> And Jesus answered them, 'See that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ," and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be *famines* and earthquakes in various places. *All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.*'"

## Methodology

The following staple crops are analyzed based on United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) data:

1. Rice
2. Wheat
3. Maize
4. Potatoes
5. Sweet Potatoes
6. Cassava
7. Sorghum
8. Millet
9. Barley
10. Oats
11. Sugarcane
12. Sugar beets
13. Bananas
14. Plantains
15. Soybeans
16. Palm oil
17. Lentils
18. Chickpeas
19. Mung beans

First, production data of all crops is normalized and visualized in nominal tons produced from $1961$ to $2021$. Then, using the UN FAO's world population data from the same time period, all crops' global production per capita are visualized in units of tons per person. Next, average kcal per ton of each staple crop is estimated in order to visualize total kcal per capita produced.

Second, production allocation to humans is accounted for. Thus, data consisting of all crops' production that is allocated to humans is normalized and visualized in nominal tons produced and allocated to humans. Like before, all crops' production and allocation to humans are compared to population growth and visualized in units of tons produced and allocated per capita. Lastly, using the average kcal per ton estimates of each crop previously computed, data consisting of total kcal per capita produced and allocated to humans from $1961$ to $2021$ is visualized. 

Additionally, crop loss is accounted for. Like was done for total production and production allocated to humans, nominal loss in tons, tons of loss per capita, and kcal of loss per capita are visualized from $1961$ to $2021$.

* Subtract human allocation and loss from total production nominally, tons per capita, and kcal per capita. This represents the maximum size of our buffer (some loss goes unaccounted for): we can take resources from manufacturing, animal production, etc. and feed it to humans if it comes down to it.

This graph, as well as total production per capita in units of kcal per person, are used to determine whether the world is better or worse equipped to feed itself.
