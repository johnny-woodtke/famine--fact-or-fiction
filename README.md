# Famine: Fact or Fiction

## Introduction and Purpose

This is a study on the world's primary staple crops' production and loss over time compared to population growth. The goal is to determine whether the world as a whole is better or worse equipped to feed itself. 

## Inspiration

The Bible teaches that, in the end times, the world will experience birth-pain-like famines (increasing in severity and intensity). It is written in Matthew 24:1-8 (emphasis mine):

> "As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, 'Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?' 
>
> And Jesus answered them, 'See that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ," and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be *famines* and earthquakes in various places. *All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.*'"
